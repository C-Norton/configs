# configs
A listing of various configuration information and lists to reference later

The content under this repo is generally intended for my own personal use. I have no issue making it public in case others may find this information beneficial in some way, but by no means is it intended for use by others.

While I may list softwares here that I use, at time of writing, I receive no special treatment or consideration from those softwares authors, distributors, etc, nor do I have any official affiliation with them beyond being a user, and in some cases, a reseller, of said products.

The appearance of a product name within this repo is by no means an endorsement, or a claim to ownership of anyone's intellectual property.
